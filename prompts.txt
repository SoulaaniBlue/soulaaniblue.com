About Page  Bio: *“Soulaani Blue (formerly known as Blue Bynum) is a self-taught recording artist, songwriter, and producer crafting soulful blends of hip-hop, R&B, and pop. Born in Colerain, NC, his journey began in a middle school choir, leading to a lifelong passion for music. Drawing inspiration from T-Pain, Smino, and SZA, Soulaani’s sound is introspective, honest, and deeply rooted in the Black experience. Under his former name, Blue Bynum, he opened for heavyweights like Fabolous, G Herbo, and 21 Savage, released collaborations like ‘Peach Gallo’ with Travon-Kare and ‘You Say’ with RAWM, and showcased his versatility long before rebranding as ‘BluetheeArtist’ in 2023. That pivotal year also saw him co-write ‘Can’t Take It’ for N’Shai Iman (150k+ streams), feature on 2AM Ricky’s ‘The Get Down,’ and release ‘Good Vibes’ with Nim & Grooveshine under Blaze Unlimited.”*  Mission Statement (Centered, Bold): “I create music to unravel the unspoken—the secrets we bury, the love we hide, and the truths we repeat until they set us free. I aim to turn pain into power, silence into revolution, and listeners into allies of their own healing.”  Timeline:  2015:  Co-founded Troubled Empire at Virginia State University.
